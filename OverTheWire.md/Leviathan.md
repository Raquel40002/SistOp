Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

This machine might hold several wargames. If you are playing "somegame", then:

* USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
* Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
* PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.
Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/. You can use the command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess directory in /tmp/. Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp directory is regularly wiped. Please play nice:

* don't leave orphan processes running
* don't leave exploit-files laying around
* don't annoy other players
* don't post passwords or spoilers
* again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
  This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!
--[ Tips ]--

This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled by default, although ASLR has been switched off. The following compiler flags might be interesting:

-m32                    compile for 32bit
-fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
-Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro
In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as executable on ELF binaries.

Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find in the following locations:

* gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
* pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
* gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
* pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
* radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
